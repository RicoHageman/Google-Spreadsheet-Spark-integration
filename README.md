# Google-Spreadsheet-Spark-integration
Inspired by Gustavo Gonnet I created a more modular and easy to use way to integrate and save your spark data in Google Spreadsheets. (https://particle.hackster.io/gusgonnet/storing-data-in-google-714dde)

# How to use:
1. Fill in your <i>particle device id</i> and <i>access token</i> in the corresponding <i>__YOUR_PARTICLE_DEVICE_ID__</i> and <i>__YOUR_PARTICLE_ACCESS_TOKEN__</i> fields
<br /><b>Note: Remember not to share this token with anybody!</b>

2. Add the required variable names, as named as the particle variable, in the <i>variables</i> array.
